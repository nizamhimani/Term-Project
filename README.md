1.	Loading the dataset into the program using pandas library. The library is rich in various functions for data manipulation and the read_csv() function was used to read the dataset files and merge() function used to merge the two files.
2.	Cleaned the data to remove any null values and empty rows.
3.	Created the mappings of the text documents and labels with the help of Numpy library.
4.	Vectorized the documents so that they can be applied to a machine learning algorithm.
5.	Designed a trainTestSplit with training and testing data.
6.	Trained the models with the dataset data. Then used the model to test on external data.
